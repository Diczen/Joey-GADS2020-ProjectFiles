# Lab: Console and Cloud Shell

## Objectives

	- Get access to Google Cloud.

	- Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.

	- Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell.

	- Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.

## Steps

1. Create a storage bucket named man4pickin2020 
   gsutil mb gs://man4pickin2020

2. Create a second bucket named man5pickin2020
   gsutil mb gs://man5pickin2020

3. Upload a file name joe.jpg stored in my computer destop to the Bucket named man4pickin2020
   gsutil cp Desktop/joe.jpg gs://man4pickin2020

## Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell

4. To list available regions
   gcloud compute regions list

5. Create an environment variable with anyone of the regions listed, example asia-east1
   INFRACLASS_REGION=[asia-east1]

6. Verify it with echo
   echo $INFRACLASS_REGION

## Append the environment variable to a file

7. Create a subdirectory for materials used in this class:
   mkdir infraclass

8. Create a file called config in the infraclass directory
   touch infraclass/config

9. Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file:
   echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config

10. Create a second environment variable for your Project ID
   INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=[qwiklabs-gcp-03-0db225c94259]

11. Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file
   echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config

12. Use the source command to set the environment variables, and use the echo command to verify that the project variable was set:
   source infraclass/config
   echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

13. Reopen shell and run the echo command
    echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

## Modify the bash profile and create persistence

14. Edit the shell profile
   nano .profile

15. Add the following line to the end of the file:
   source infraclass/config

16.Close and reopen shell and verify that the variable is still set:
   echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
