# LAB: Error Reporting and Debugging 

## Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
	a. Launch a simple Google App Engine application

	b. Introduce an error into the application

	c. Explore Cloud Error Reporting

	d. Use Cloud Debugger to identify the error in the code

	e. Fix the bug and monitor in Cloud Operations

## Steps

1. To create a local folder and get the App Engine Hello world application run the following commands in the gcloud command line interface
   mkdir appengine-hello
   cd appengine-hello
   gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/archinfra/gae-hello/* .

2. Run the application using the local development server with the following command
   dev_appserver.py $(pwd) 

3. Exit the Deployment Manager
   Ctrl+c

4. Deploy the application to App Engine, select east-asia region and Select Yes to continue with the following commands;
   gcloud app deploy app.yaml
   1
   Y

5. Verify that the application is working
   gcloud app browse

## Introducing an error to break the application
6. To examine the main.py
   cat main.py

7. Use the sed stream editor to change the import library to the nonexistent webapp22
   sed -i -e 's/webapp2/webapp22/' main.py

8. Verify the change made in the main.py file
   cat main.py

9. Re-deploy the application to App Engine
   gcloud app deploy app.yaml --quiet

10. verify that the application is broken by running
   gcloud app browse

11. To view the error logs 
   gcloud logging logs list

12. Fix the error by running
   sed -i -e 's/webapp22/webapp2/' main.py

13. Re-deploy the application to App Engine
   gcloud app deploy app.yaml --quiet

14. Verify that the application is working again
   gcloud app browse
